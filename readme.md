Pluralsight.FSharp.Jumpstart
===================

This is some code written by watching the pluralsight course [F# Jumpstart](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fsharp-jumpstart/table-of-contents) so it can serve as a go-to reference later.

Solution structure
----------
 - *Pluralsight.FSharp.Jumpstart* - F# console project (dummy)
 - *Pluralsight.FSharp.Jumpstart.Lib* - F# library with most of the code from course
 - *Pluralsight.FSharp.Jumpstart.UnitTest* - Unit tests of *Pluralsight.FSharp.Jumpstart.Lib* in C# / xUnit in order to represent how to call F# from C# assembly (e.g. how to consume discriminated unions)
